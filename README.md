# Environment Setup
After cloning the repository, open the repo in an IDE (VSCode is recommended here).

In a terminal, run the following command

```
npm i
```

These commands will install the necessary extensions and applications for running the website. If you are working in VSCode or an IDE that has this function, ensure autosave is on while working.

# Running Locally
To run the ARC website locally, in the terminal run the following command

```
npm start
```

# Code Formatting

The code is formatted using Prettier. The following scripts check what files need formatting, and format the files:

```
npm run check
npm run write
```
